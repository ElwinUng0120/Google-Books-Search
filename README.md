    - *package.json*: contains basic info about the server such as command line instructions and packages used
    - *routes* folder: contains all API endpoints
    - *index.js* in *routes* folder: add prefix to api endpoints when hosted by *server.js*
    - *models* folder: contains files for creating schema on MongoDB

    - *utils/API.js*: contains all API calls to the server as functions, which will be used by different React components in the *components* folder
    - *App.js*: used as a router, which will call different master React component from *pages* folder depending on the path/URL
    - *index.js*: used to insert the contents generated by *App.js* to *index.html* in the *public* folder
    - *public* folder: auto-generated files by React
    - package.json: contains basic info about the client-side server such as command line instructions and packages used
